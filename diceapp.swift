/** To change the properties of the UI Object in the Main.Storyboard file, use the who.what = value equation. It is also called the dot notation where: who = which particular variable or UI component object needs to be changed.
 what = what is the type of the UI compnent that needs to be changed. Example, whether it's an image UI component or a string UI component or a label.This is also accessing the property of the view/UI object such as "image" or "alpha".
 value = Assigning a new value to the UI component when the viewDidLoad function is called or executed by the app.
 Note that the image literal that was available in Xcode 13 does not work on Xcode 14. In Xcode 14, use the UIImage(named: string) method to access and change the property/attribute of the specified UIImage element/object.
 
 EDIT: The most current way to use image literals is #imageLiteral( for graphical representation of your images uploaded in Xcode project.
